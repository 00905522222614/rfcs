# How to run an Open RFC Meeting

**Note:** Much of the current RFC meeting process is handled manually, if you find time to automate any of this it would be greatly appreciated <3 
 
## Preparation for a Call
1. Ensure an event has been booked in the **npm Public Events Calendar** (note: the title of the event must start with "Open RFC") at least a week ahead of time
1. The week before, or week of, run the `npm run agenda` script to create the agenda issue in `npm/rfcs` via https://github.com/npm/statusboard (TODO: this script should be moved)

## Day-of Call
1. Create a corresponding [**hackmd.io**](https://hackmd.io/) shared document & copy the agenda into the notes
```md
<!-- ex. template -->
