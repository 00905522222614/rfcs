# npm patches management - a new structure for community collaborators

## Summary

This document proposes an organizational structure and set of processes that
change the way the npm CLI team interacts with external collaborators. It
establishes some new positions that collaborators can be granted as they learn
about and commit to the project.

## Motivation

Ultimately, the goal is to open up development of the npm CLI as much as
possible, to maximize input (and contribution) from the community while
uplifting the wonderful folks who help us, and balancing that with npm, Inc's
company and product-related needs (and, potentially, future organizations that
may pay for developer time).

Right now, and for most of the history of the project, there's been no clear way
to "become" a contributor to npm that has more responsibility than any other
given community member. This has had some less than pleasant effects: For one,
it's discouraged continued contribution from interested parties and dissuaded
them from putting in the time necessary to "learn the ropes" of what has
historically been a pretty difficult codebase to deal with. For two, it puts the
entire load of any significant development or project decisions squarely on the
shoulders of the core CLI team, which at the time of this writing was a mere two
full-time developers.

And those two developers are hella burnt out on a regular basis.

At the same time, it's important to keep in mind that labor has value, and
having community members providing significant amounts of work to a project
uncompensated raises unpleasant ethical concerns and can often be an
exploitative practice, especially for some marginalized communities. It is,
essentially, paramount to asking artists for free art "for the exposure". In the
end, "exposure" is not acceptable compensation for human labor, especially
compared to cold, hard cash.

In short, the concrete goals of this process are:

* Get the community to have more ownership over a project that affects so many of them. Give them the ability to propose and make meaningful changes to the project and feel genuinely empowered to do so.
* Lighten the load on the core CLI team so they can increase their focus on features, fixes, and products that benefit the most from their domain expertise.
* Keep npm development nimble: allow efficient decision-making and find ways to prevent the long, exhausting stalemates that tend to lock down consensus-based systems.
* Preserve npm, Inc's ability to build its products for the good of the community and allow it to continue guiding its development, while empowering the community to have their own meaningful say in how that works or conflicts with their own needs and goals.
* Integrate other stakeholders more actively in our development process (such as Node Core)
* Increase the overall quality of the project by increased participation "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow".
* Uplift community members that have contributed to this shared project, raising their status in the open source community.
* Encourage sustainable corporate investment into open source and the people that work on it.
* Create a positive, creative, educational, and fun environment for the npm developer community to connect and network with each other while doing cool stuff together!

## Detailed Explanation

<!-- TODO: specific roles, structure, decision-making processes, and all that governance hullabaloo -->

## Rationale and Alternatives

<!-- TODO: write once the above is fleshed out a bit (and document ideas that are passed up and why) -->

{{Discuss 2-3 different alternative solutions that were considered. This is required, even if it seems like a stretch. Then explain why this is the best choice out of available ones.}}

## Implementation

<!-- TODO: discuss transition plan, bootstrap exceptions, and resources required -->

## Prior Art

<!-- TODO: plenty of FOSS out there. It's worth studying how some of them are structured -->

{{This section is optional if there are no actual prior examples in other tools}}

{{Discuss existing examples of this change in other tools, and how they've addressed various concerns discussed above, and what the effect of those decisions has been}}

## Unresolved Questions and Bikeshedding

{{Write about any arbitrary decisions that need to be made (syntax, colors, formatting, minor UX decisions), and any questions for the proposal that have not been answered.}}

{{THIS SECTION SHOULD BE REMOVED BEFORE RATIFICATION}}
